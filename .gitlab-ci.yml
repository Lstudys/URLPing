# Auto DevOps
# This CI/CD configuration provides a standard pipeline for
# * building a Docker image (using a buildpack if necessary),
# * storing the image in the container registry,
# * running tests from a buildpack,
# * running code quality analysis,
# * creating a review app for each topic branch,
# * and continuous deployment to production
#
# Test jobs may be disabled by setting environment variables:
# * test: TEST_DISABLED
# * code_quality: CODE_QUALITY_DISABLED
# * license_management: LICENSE_MANAGEMENT_DISABLED
# * performance: PERFORMANCE_DISABLED
# * load_performance: LOAD_PERFORMANCE_DISABLED
# * sast: SAST_DISABLED
# * secret_detection: SECRET_DETECTION_DISABLED
# * dependency_scanning: DEPENDENCY_SCANNING_DISABLED
# * container_scanning: CONTAINER_SCANNING_DISABLED
# * dast: DAST_DISABLED
# * review: REVIEW_DISABLED
# * stop_review: REVIEW_DISABLED
# * code_intelligence: CODE_INTELLIGENCE_DISABLED
#
# In order to deploy, you must have a Kubernetes cluster configured either
# via a project integration, or via group/project variables.
# KUBE_INGRESS_BASE_DOMAIN must also be set on the cluster settings,
# as a variable at the group or project level, or manually added below.
#
# Continuous deployment to production is enabled by default.
# If you want to deploy to staging first, set STAGING_ENABLED environment variable.
# If you want to enable incremental rollout, either manual or time based,
# set INCREMENTAL_ROLLOUT_MODE environment variable to "manual" or "timed".
# If you want to use canary deployments, set CANARY_ENABLED environment variable.
#
# If Auto DevOps fails to detect the proper buildpack, or if you want to
# specify a custom buildpack, set a project variable `BUILDPACK_URL` to the
# repository URL of the buildpack.
# e.g. BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby.git#v142
# If you need multiple buildpacks, add a file to your project called
# `.buildpacks` that contains the URLs, one on each line, in order.
# Note: Auto CI does not work with multiple buildpacks yet
